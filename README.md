# Comparative Visualization of Brain Scans

![alt text](https://github.com/jakobtroidl/MedVis1/blob/master/teaser.PNG)

A visual tool to efficiently compare multiple MRI based brain scans. You can find a detailed description [here](https://github.com/jakobtroidl/MedVis1/blob/master/report.pdf).

## Getting started
* Download [MeVisLab](https://www.mevislab.de/download).
* Create a local folder `_data_` and exclude it from git.
* Download the [data](https://brainweb.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/anatomic_normal_20.html) as MINC files with suffix "_crisp_v.mnc" files. Copy paste the data into the `_data_` folder. We used _subject04_crisp_v.mnc_ for the first visualization. In the .mlab file, set this file as source, maybe reset LUTs and maybe restart the program, then the visualizations (binary and silhouette) should be displayed.
