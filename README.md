# Comparative visualization of 20 brain scans

## Setup
Make a local folder _data_ and exclude it from git.

Download the brain scans as MINC files with suffix "_crisp_v.mnc" files. (I currently used _subject04_crisp_v.mnc_ for first visualization.) in the .mlab file, set the file as source, maybe reset LUTs and maybe restart the program, then the visualizations (binary and silhouette) should be displayed.
